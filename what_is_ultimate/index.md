title: What is Ultimate?

Ultimate or "Ultimate Frisbee" is a non-contact sport of athletisism,
endurance and skill. Below are a list of 10 basic rules to the game of
Ultmate (also referred to as "Ultimate Frisbee"). This should help you
get started and on your way to understanding the sport of ultimate
frisbee a little better.

### 1. Start of Ultimate Frisbee Play

To begin play the ultimate players from each team line up on their
endzones and the defense team pulls (throws) the disc to the other team
as a "kick-off". Pulls are long throws, and they are thrown in efforts
of giving the offiensive team poor field position and a chance for the
defense to get down the field soon enough to stop advances. Teams
consists of 7 players each.

### 2. Movement of the Disc

The disc may be moved in any direction by completing a pass to a
teammate. After catching a pass, a player is required to come to a stop
as quickly as possible, and then can only move their non-pivot foot.

### 3. Scoring in Ultimate

A point is scored when a player catches a pass in the endzone his team
is attacking.

### 4. Change of Possession

An incomplete pass results in a change of possession. When this happens
the defense immediately becomes the offense and gains possession of the
ultimate disc where it comes to a stop on the field of play, or where it
first traveled out of bounds. Play does not stop because of a turnover.

### 5. Reasons for Turnovers

- Throw-away -- the thrower misses his target and the ultimate disc falls to the ground.
- Drop -- the receiver is not able to catch the disc.
- Block -- a defender deflects the disc in mid flight, causing it to hit the ground.
- Interception -- a defender catches a disc thrown by the offense.
- Out of bounds -- the disc lands out of bounds, hits an object out of bounds or
  is caught by a player who lands out of bounds or leaps from outside the playing field.
- Stall -- a player on offense does not release the disc before the defender has
  counted out ten seconds.

### 6. Ultimate Frisbee Fouls

A foul is the result of contact between players, although incidental
contact (not affecting the play) does not constitute a foul. When a foul
disrupts possession, the play resumes as if the possession were
retained. If the player committing the foul disagrees with the foul
call, the disc is returned to the last thrower.

### 7. Ultimate Player Substitutions

Teams are allowed to substitute ultimate players after a point is scored
or for an injured player after an injury time out. In the case of an
injury substitution, the opposing team is allowed to make a substitution
for a non-injured player.

### 8. Refereeing

Players are responsible for foul and line calls. Players resolve their
own disputes. This creates a spirit of honesty and respect on the
playing field. It is the duty of the player who committed the foul to
speak up and admit his infraction. Occasionally, official observers are
used to aid players in refereeing, known as observers.

### 9. Ultimate Frisbee Strategies

Teams employ many different offensive strategies with different goals.
Most basic strategies are an attempt to create open lanes on the field
for the exchange of the disc between the thrower and the receiver.
Organized teams assign positions to the players based on their specific
strengths. Designated throwers are called handlers and designated
receivers are called cutters. The amount of autonomy or overlap between
these positions depends on the make-up of the team.

### 10. Spirit of the Game

Ultimate Frisbee is known for its "Spirit of the Game", often
abbreviated SOTG. Ultimate's self-officiated nature demands a strong
spirit of sportsmanship and respect.
