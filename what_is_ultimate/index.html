title: What is Ultimate?
---

<p>Ultimate or "Ultimate Frisbee" is a non-contact sport of athletisism, endurance and skill. Below are a list of 10 basic rules to the game of Ultmate (also referred to as "Ultimate Frisbee"). This should help you get started and on your way to understanding the sport of ultimate frisbee a little better.</p>

<h3>1. Start of Ultimate Frisbee Play</h3>

<p>To begin play the ultimate players from each team line up on their endzones and the defense team pulls (throws) the disc to the other team as a "kick-off". Pulls are long throws, and they are thrown in efforts of giving the offiensive team poor field position and a chance for the defense to get down the field soon enough to stop advances. Teams consists of 7 players each.</p>

<h3>2. Movement of the Disc</h3>
<p>The disc may be moved in any direction by completing a pass to a teammate. After catching a pass, a player is required to come to a stop as quickly as possible, and then can only move their non-pivot foot.</p>

<h3>3. Scoring in Ultimate</h3>
<p>A point is scored when a player catches a pass in the endzone his team is attacking.</p>

<h3>4. Change of Possession</h3>
<p>An incomplete pass results in a change of possession. When this happens the defense immediately becomes the offense and gains possession of the ultimate disc where it comes to a stop on the field of play, or where it first traveled out of bounds. Play does not stop because of a turnover.</p>

<h3>5. Reasons for Turnovers</h3>
<p>
		Throw-away - the thrower misses his target and the ultimate disc falls to the ground.
		<br>Drop - the receiver is not able to catch the disc.
		<br>Block - a defender deflects the disc in mid flight, causing it to hit the ground.
		<br>Interception - a defender catches a disc thrown by the offense.
		<br>Out of bounds - the disc lands out of bounds, hits an object out of bounds or is caught by a player who lands out of bounds or leaps from outside the playing field.
		<br>Stall - a player on offense does not release the disc before the defender has counted out ten seconds.

<h3>6. Ultimate Frisbee Fouls</h3>
<p>A foul is the result of contact between players, although incidental contact (not affecting the play) does not constitute a foul. When a foul disrupts possession, the play resumes as if the possession were retained. If the player committing the foul disagrees with the foul call, the disc is returned to the last thrower.</p>

<h3>7. Ultimate Player Substitutions</h3>
<p>Teams are allowed to substitute ultimate players after a point is scored or for an injured player after an injury time out. In the case of an injury substitution, the opposing team is allowed to make a substitution for a non-injured player.</p>

<h3>8. Refereeing</h3>
<p>Players are responsible for foul and line calls. Players resolve their own disputes. This creates a spirit of honesty and respect on the playing field. It is the duty of the player who committed the foul to speak up and admit his infraction. Occasionally, official observers are used to aid players in refereeing, known as observers.</p>

<h3>9. Ultimate Frisbee Strategies</h3>
<p>Teams employ many different offensive strategies with different goals. Most basic strategies are an attempt to create open lanes on the field for the exchange of the disc between the thrower and the receiver. Organized teams assign positions to the players based on their specific strengths. Designated throwers are called handlers and designated receivers are called cutters. The amount of autonomy or overlap between these positions depends on the make-up of the team.</p>

<h3>10. Spirit of the Game</h3>
<p>Ultimate Frisbee is known for its "Spirit of the Game", often abbreviated SOTG. Ultimate's self-officiated nature demands a strong spirit of sportsmanship and respect.</p>
