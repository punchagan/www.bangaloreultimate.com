**Enjoy the game, play it. It's free.**

Ultimate is fun, spirited, and inclusive! Its played by boys and girls
of all ages. Successful play promotes teamwork, sportsmanship, fitness,
and personal empowerment. Unlike most sports, Ultimate has no referee or
umpire, requiring players to resolve on-field disputes according to a
personal code of ethics referred to as Spirit of the Game. This
philosophy instills a unique sense of mutual respect and unity among all
players. Ultimate is played passionately by millions of people in more
than 40 countries around the world.

It is an incredibly social and friendly sport, played by a range of
people of differing ages and experience. It's cheap â€” all you need is
some friends, some grass and a disc. And best of all its loads of fun.

A range of individuals join us at our weekly game sessions, from school
kids to doctors, from fitness freaks to sport enthusiasts. The core
members of Bangalore Ultimate have helped groom a number of individuals,
they are now playing for some of the best teams in the country. If you
